A simple neural network with one hidden layer, training on a small dataset using ReLU activation for non-linearity, dropout for regularization, learning rate decay for smoother convergence, and early stopping to avoid overfitting.
The training process involves forward propagation to generate predictions, backpropagation to update weights, periodic adjustment of the learning rate, and monitoring of validation loss to determine when to stop training.

Batch normalization is not explicitly implemented. However, if desired, we can add batch normalization layers after the affine transformations (np.dot) in the forward propagation step. Dropout is implemented during the forward propagation step. 
A dropout rate of 0.2 is used, which randomly sets 20%.

The weight initialization is done using np.random.randn, which provides samples from a standard normal distribution. This initialization is more effective than the previous approach of using a fixed range.
The learning rate scheduling is implemented using a decay factor (lr_decay) and a step size (lr_decay_step). The learning rate is multiplied by the decay factor every lr_decay_step.
